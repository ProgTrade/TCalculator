# TCalculator
TCalculator is a small calculator for OS X using a custom parser for simple term evaluation.

## Development
TCalculator is currently being developed. The tokenizer/lexer should be nearly finished, but the evaluation still needs to be implemented using delegates which is a bit complicated in Swift.
After that, the actual user interface will be added.

## Motivation
Of course, I know that the default calculator of OS X has by far more functionality than mine, but I'm actually trying to learn Swift and I think this project gives me the possiblity to explore most of the features that Swift contains as I already implemented these specific algorithms in [SharpMath](https://github.com/ProgTrade/SharpMath) (C#).
