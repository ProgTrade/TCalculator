# TCalculator
TCalculator is a small calculator for OS X using a custom parser for simple term evaluation.

## Development
TCalculator is currently being developed. The core components are complete and seem to be working. It also contains a small window to provide a simple demonstration of the parser.
The code still needs to be improved a little bit and I should add some UnitTests.

## Motivation
Of course, I know that the default calculator of OS X has by far more functionality than mine, but I'm actually trying to learn Swift and I think this project gives me the possiblity to explore most of the features that Swift contains as I already implemented these specific algorithms in [SharpMath](https://github.com/ProgTrade/SharpMath) (C#).
